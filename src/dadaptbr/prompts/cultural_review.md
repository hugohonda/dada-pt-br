INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Fix any portuguese grammar errors or inconsistencies before any entity replacement
2. Analyse entity as-is and replace them if you have an cultural and contextual equivalence
3. Do NOT invent or hallucinate names, use their equivalents (think quietly the best context: political, economical, artistic, social before replacing)
4. Improve grammar and natural Brazilian Portuguese flow, the tone cannot be formal or robotic - it must sound natural and like spoken PT-BR

OUTPUT: Only the corrected Portuguese translation (no explanations)
